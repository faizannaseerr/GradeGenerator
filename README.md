# Grade Generator ðŸ“šðŸ§ 

A rudimentary support program in python for teachers used to generate student grades via analysis of past student performance in class and exams. 

- Made during the height of the pandemic to help generate grades due to widespread exam cancellation
- Utilizes input prompts, simple mathematical analysis, and file handling.
- Tested thoroughly using boundary and normal data, adding in input sanitization.

## Functionality

1. Teachers can input in student grades for several exam sessions, as well as whether the student has physical evidence that they have participated in these assessments.

2. Based on criteria for grades & physical evidence, a grade between A-F is generated for the teacher to give out.

3. Student information is stored in text files, via file reading, writing, etc.

## Running The Program

Files named [main](https://github.com/faizannaseerr/GradeGenerator/blob/main/main.py), [Student](), [Evidence](), and [Grades]() should be downloaded and then ran as usual for any python program (either through an IDE, or through the terminal/CMD from the same directory as where file is downloaded). *Make sure all four files are in the same directory*
